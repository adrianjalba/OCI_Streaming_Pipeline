### Objective
This repository leverages Oracle Cloud Infrasturcture's array of services to deploy a low-code end-to-end streaming pipeline.  The included Terraform Stack handles resource deployment, and additional configuration steps are documented below.  The resulting architecture is a cloud-native streaming pipeline, capable of data ingestion, processing, strorage, and analysis. 

### Prerequisites
* An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy or trial.

### Included Resources
* Oracle Analytics Cloud
* Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse
* Oracle Compute Intance
* Oracle Functions
* Oracle Object Storage
* Oracle Service Connector Hub
* Oracle Streaming
* Oracle Virtual Cloud Network, Subnet
