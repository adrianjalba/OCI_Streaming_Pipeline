# OCI Streaming Pipeline
This document provides instructions for deployment and configuration of a cloud-native streaming and anaylsis pipeline using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

## Table of Contents

## Introduction
Data streaming is a powerful tool capable of accelerating business processes and facilitating real-time decision making across a wide variety of industries and use cases. There are many ways to implement streaming technology, and each solution offers different benefits and drawbacks. The approach documented below is a cloud-native, low-code approach to streaming, covering the complete data lifecycle from ingestion to analysis. This will enable organizations to implement a complete streaming pipeline quickly without the need for a highly specialized team of developers.

### Objective
This repository leverages Oracle Cloud Infrasturcture's array of services to deploy a low-code end-to-end streaming pipeline.  The included Terraform Stack handles resource deployment, and additional configuration steps are documented below.  The resulting architecture is a cloud-native streaming pipeline, capable of data ingestion, processing, strorage, and analysis. 

### Prerequisites
* An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy or trial.

### Included Resources
* Oracle Analytics Cloud
* Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse
* Oracle Compute Intance
* Oracle Functions
* Oracle Object Storage
* Oracle Service Connector Hub
* Oracle Streaming
* Oracle Virtual Cloud Network & Subnet
